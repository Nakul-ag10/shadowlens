# 🛡️ ShadowLens  
### AI-Powered TLS Interception & Network Anomaly Detection Platform

ShadowLens is an explainable cybersecurity analysis platform that detects suspicious TLS behavior and potential network interception using probabilistic reasoning powered by **Google Gemini**. It transforms low-level network signals into high-level, human-readable security insights through an **antivirus-style SOC dashboard**.

## 🚀 Why ShadowLens?

Most network security tools raise alerts but fail to explain *why* an event is risky. ShadowLens solves this by:

- Correlating TLS handshake anomalies
- Identifying proxy-based TLS interception
- Generating structured, explainable AI insights
- Visualizing risk in a familiar antivirus-style dashboard
